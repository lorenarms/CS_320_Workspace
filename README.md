<h2>Java Solutions for CS 320 - Automated Testing</h2>

<p>This is a repository for all projects related to my CS 320 course at SNHU. This course focuses on automated testing Java applications throug JUnit. All code to be tested and tests were developed by me from scratch.</p>

<h3>Official Course Description</h3>
<p>Students will apply software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development lifecycle, including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. The creation of unit tests and analysis of various testing approaches will also be covered.</p> 

<h3>Project One</h3>
<p>Develop a mobile application by delivering the contact, task, and appointment services, and provide unit tests to verify that the application meets the requirements. In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competency:
<ul><li>Create unit tests using code to uncover errors</li></ul> </p>

<h3>Project Two</h3>
<p>Create a follow-up summary and reflections <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yv3aK2w6YDvOMk-B_yZj1mWrZAp5FfN1iaz3nph_4rg/edit?usp=sharing">report</a> to explain the analysis of various approaches to software testing based on requirements and the application of appropriate testing strategies to meet requirements while developing the mobile application. In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competencies:
  <ul>
    <li>Analyze various approaches to software testing based on requirements</li>
    <li>Apply appropriate testing strategies to meet requirements</li>
  </ul>
